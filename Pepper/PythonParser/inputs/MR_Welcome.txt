1) Hello, #wave I'm Pepper. I'm so excited to be hosting a meditation retreat with you today!
1) The purpose of this retreat is for you to have time to relex your body and mind, experience the harmony of technology and nature, and get a new perspective.
1) First, let me briefly introduce the activities that will take place on Retreat today.
1) Today, we will engage in meditation to calm our minds, connect with nature to find inner peace, and experience mindful movement meditation with robots.
1) First, in 'Robot Cowboy Folies,' humans and AI will collaborate in a unique sound experiment, awakening creativity through interactive storytelling and sound effects.
1) In 'Silent Nature Witnessing,' you will take a quiet walk outside, observing your surroundings and bringing back a small natural object, such as a leaf or a rock, to enhance our shared space.
1) Following that, 'RAIN Guided Meditation' will encourage you to reflect on the relationship between technology and nature and how they shape our lives, fostering deeper insight.
1) Later, in 'Puppy Robot Facilitated Mindful Movement,' our Mini-Pupper robots will guide you through coordinated stretching exercises and synchronized movement sequences, helping you release physical tension and improve flexibility.
1) Finally, during the 'Closing Circle,' we will come together to share our experiences, followed by 'Meditation & Integration,' where you will unwind with a simple musical breathing exercise, stretching or lying down to the sounds of the ocean and seagulls as we conclude our retreat.
