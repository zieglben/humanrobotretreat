# Core Findings: HRI with Meditation

Through the design, development, and facilitation of this meditation retreat, we gained insight into how humans perceive and interact with robots in wellness contexts. Participants often approached the robots with both **interest and confusion**. While many were eager to engage and see what the robots could do, unfamiliarity with meditation practices—or with robots themselves—often made initial interaction challenging. This highlighted the importance of **clear guidance**, **gentle onboarding**, and **bridging unfamiliar environments** to make robot-assisted meditation more accessible and effective.

The natural solution, a human-in-the-loop approach, was often reached with our robot deployments, especially with the coordinate system stretching using the Mini-Pupper 2. The Mini-Pupper has a very rigid body, with not much room for expression, so while it may have seemed very clear what the intended movements were for the development team, the audience often found it difficult to understand what they were to do without a human demonstration alongside the robot. This human-in-the-loop approach bridged the gap between the robot coordinate system and the human coordinate system in a way that made sense for participants who had no prior knowledge of the activities during that portion of the retreat. 

Social setup, room layout, and egocentric vs exocentric instructions also impacted the delivery of the Mini-Pupper exercise and stretching routines. With more people in the room at our first iteration, it was more difficult to find space and settle on a placement of participants that didn't limit anyone's view of the robot or overall experience. As pictured below, the layout we decided on was the robot and human facilitator up front, and everyone else spaced evenly behind the robot. Modeling after a yoga or exercise class, the human facilitator faced the audience and provided mostly egocentric instructions from the perspective of the audience, which made it much easier for participants to understand their instructions. While this approach likely removes the need for a robot instructor, as the human is much more expressive and instructive, we found that the robot served as a necessary and interesting distraction.

Drawing from their time developing the program and knowledge of programming, the human facilitator often revealed behind-the-scenes information about the development process in the form of instructions. For example, the exercise routine is mostly coded using a looping structure, so when participants asked how long the routine was, the instructor hinted at it being a simple loop, offering both comedic relief and a better understanding of the inner-workings of the Mini-Pupper's programming. We found that while the retreat was intended to be a quiet, relaxing experience, humor often found its way in and enhanced the experience for everyone involved. Therefore, for the second retreat, the Mini-Pupper team iterated upon that to create funny vocal scripts for the robot to use when introducing the team and itself that referenced the audience to deliver some of its comedy. 

## Development Challenges
- **Robot connectivity**: Ensuring stable Wi-Fi and power in varied locations 
- **Gesture/audio sync**: Timing issues resolved with human intervention
- **Battery life**: Retreat schedule adjusted to include rest intervals
- **Room booking**: Ensure a room big enough for 10-20 people for 3 hours few weeks before deployments
