This repository and its contents were developed as part of a Senior Capstone project at Oregon State University from September 2024 - June 2025, in collaboration with the CHARISMA Lab on campus. The project followed up on a 6-month robot-led meditation series from January – June 2024 by the CHARISMA Lab at OSU.

# Why Robots?

Meditation and mindfulness practices have gained popularity in recent years, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased isolation and stress. While many automated meditation resources, such as apps or scripted videos, offer accessible guidance, they lack the dynamic and embodied interaction that is offered by in-person guided meditation. This project explored how leveraging the physical presence of robots can enhance meditation experiences beyond static, pre-recorded scripts.

# Retreat Structure

The retreat is designed to be an approximately 3-hour session, balancing participant engagement and robot operational limits. The flow maximizes interaction with multiple robot/system deployments while incorporating natural transitions between activities. While a longer session would give participants more time to interact with the robots, it is also important to consider the robot battery life, audience attention span, and effectiveness of a longer session. 

Importantly, the retreat structure is modular, allowing facilitators to modify the experience as needed. Each segment can be used independently, which supports future template development and broader adoption by non-technical audiences. The retreat schedule is as follows:
