_Mini-Pupper 2 (left) and Pepper (right) robots were the main systems used for this project as pictured above._

This repository and its contents were developed as part of a Senior Capstone project at Oregon State University from September 2024 - June 2025, in collaboration with the CHARISMA Lab on campus. The project followed up on a 6-month robot-led meditation series from January â€“ June 2024 by the CHARISMA Lab at OSU.

# Why Robots?

Meditation and mindfulness practices have gained popularity in recent years, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased isolation and stress. While many automated meditation resources, such as apps or scripted videos, offer accessible guidance, they lack the dynamic and embodied interaction that is offered by in-person guided meditation. This project explored how leveraging the physical presence of robots can enhance meditation experiences beyond static, pre-recorded scripts.

# Retreat Structure

The retreat is designed to be an approximately 3-hour session, balancing participant engagement and robot operational limits. The flow maximizes interaction with multiple robot/system deployments while incorporating natural transitions between activities. While a longer session would give participants more time to interact with the robots, it is also important to consider the robot battery life, audience attention span, and effectiveness of a longer session.

## Pepper

### Pepper Python SDK Integration & Parser

We used the Python SDK (NAOqi) to create custom scripts for the Pepper robot without relying solely on Choregraphe.

#### Project Structure

- pynaoqi-python2.7-2.8.6.23-win64-vs2015-20191127_152649: Official Python SDK for Pepper
- PythonParser/: Python scripts for controlling Pepper
- PythonParser/inputs: Input text scripts (InputScript.txt)
- PythonParser/outputs: Generated files (e.g., commandFile.csv, .wav)
- PythonParser1/parser.py: Parses and generates CSV timeline/audio from the input script
- PythonParser2/pepperExecute.py: Runs gestures and speech on Pepper using NAOqi

#### Setup Instructions

1. Install NAOqi SDK
Download the pynaoqi-python2.7-2.8.6.23-win64-vs2015-20191127_152649.
2. Add the SDK path to your Python 2.7 environment.
Windows
In the Environment Variables window, add a new User variable:
_PYTHONPATH_
and set it to:
_path\to\python-sdk\lib_

Mac
Set the environment variables PYTHONPATH and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to /path/to/python-sdk
By doing for example:
__$ export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/python-sdk/lib/python2.7/site-packages_
_$ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/path/to/python-sdk/lib_

Linux
Set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to /path/to/python-sdk/lib/python2.7/site-packages
By doing for example:
_$ export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/python-sdk/lib/python2.7/site-packages_
3. Ensure Pepper and your machine are on the same network.

#### Input Script Format

Example (InputScript.txt):
_1) Hello #wave I am Pepper and I am going to speak about the garden of serenity._
_2) I am #shocked also Pepper #raise_up_
_1) But I am curious about the next line #wave_

- 1 or 2 indicates voice ID.
- #wave, #raise_up, #shocked refer to gestures deployed in Choregraphe.

#### Configuration

Example (config.py):
_PEPPER_IP = '192.168.xx.xxx'_
_PEPPER_PORT = 9559_
_INPUT_FILE = '../inputs/InputScript.txt' #Select the input text file you want to output_
_SPEAKER_WAV = '../inputs/female.wav'_
_BACKGROUND_SOUND = None_

#### How to Run

1. Generate Output Files
_python3 PythonParser1/parser.py_

2. Execute on Pepper (Python 2.7)
_python PythonParser2/pepperExecute.py_

This will:
- Parse the input test
- Play generated .wav files
- Trigger corresponding robot gestures
- Synchronize both via commandFile.csv

#### Notes

- pepperExecute.py must be run with Python 2.7
- parser.py works with latest Python version as well
- NAOqi SDK is required and must be sourced for execution
- Pepper must be powered on and reachable via the specified IP
