## Mini Pupper Quick Start Guide

> **Important:**   
> The implementation of the Mini-Pupper 2 that we used was stored locally on the CHARISMA Lab's robot and was previously setup for the lab's use. Please refer to the [Stanford Quadruped implementation on the MangDang Robotics Club Github](https://github.com/mangdangroboticsclub/StanfordQuadruped?tab=readme-ov-file#mini-pupper) for instructions on how to setup the robot.
