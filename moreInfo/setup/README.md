# Robot Setup Information

For first time setup, please review the documentation for [Pepper](#pepper-quick-start-guide) and [Mini Pupper](#mini-pupper-quick-start-guide) below.

## Mini Pupper Quick Start Guide

> **Important:**   
> The implementation of the Mini-Pupper 2 that we used was stored locally on the CHARISMA Lab's robot and was previously setup for the lab's use. Please refer to the [Stanford Quadruped implementation on the MangDang Robotics Club Github](https://github.com/mangdangroboticsclub/StanfordQuadruped?tab=readme-ov-file#mini-pupper) for instructions on how to setup the robot for use with our implementation.

## Pepper Quick Start Guide

> **Important:**  
> Please use **Choregraphe version 2.5.10.7** to ensure full compatibility with the NAOqi SDK and Pepper robot.  
> Other versions may cause compatibility issues or failed deployments.
