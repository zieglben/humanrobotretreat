## Mindful Breathing with Robot: An Exercise in Silence

This exercise was developed by the CHARISMA Robotics Lab, combining emerging human-robot interaction research with foundational mindfulness practices. The use of breath awareness is a well-established technique for reducing stress and promoting emotional balance, as supported by research from Harvard Health Publishing and practices described by Mindful.org.

Time: 0:30–1:00

Activity: Guided Sitting Meditation with Mini-Pupper

### Flow

- Participants are invited to sit comfortably, either on a cushion or chair.

- Mini-Pupper and a human facilitator introduce the practice of sitting meditation.

- The guidance includes:

  - Noticing the breath.

  - Observing sensations, sounds, or bodily feelings.
    
  - Gentle breathing instructions (e.g., “Inhale deeply, exhale slowly.”).

- Participants are reminded that distraction is normal; the key is to gently return attention to the breath when wandering occurs.
