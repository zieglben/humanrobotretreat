### Flow

1. Participants are seated or lying comfortably on the floor.

2. The OctoDrum system (developed by OPeNs Lab) plays gentle seagull and ocean sounds.

3. A guided musical breathing exercise leads participants through stretching or restful stillness.

The retreat concludes with a closing message:

"Remember today's experience and keep your peace of mind going forward. It’s okay also if your gears are sometimes frenetically turning. Remember your anchors."
