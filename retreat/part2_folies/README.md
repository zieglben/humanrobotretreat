#  Robot Cowboy Folies: An Exercise in Cacophony and Noticing

The folies activity was developed by Jacob Strand in the Capstone team to let out stress and emotion through noise and story telling. The group will tell a story with a centeralized person acting as a conductor and others playing the parts of the characters. For this retreat formate we performed a story about a robot cowboy named Rusty (The Heroic Tale of Rusty the Robot). Notes on how to create new stories are in (Sonify working notes) and (Stories with audience interaction).

Activity: Robot Cowboy Folies - Storytelling in group

### Creation of a Story

If writting isn't a practice skill you have or are low on time it is suggested to use a Large Language Model (LLM) to help create an initial draft. MAKE SURE TO EDIT LLM's INITAL DRAFT AFTER. Some models are better than others at writting and good prompting can provide better results, but the human aspet is what makes the story interesting. The most important part is to have fun with both the performance and the writting. 

The story is to be created with noise in mind. Making sound effects out of random everyday objects such as cards, broom, rocks, metal baskets, anthing you can think of, or is in reach, can and should be used. Improvasation must be incorraged. We're not creating a cinima master piece. Our goal is to let some noise out and have fun. 

### Flow/Instructions:

1. Guide participants in a circle sitting
2. Ask volunteer or pick participants for reading/acting the scripts

  **Note: Facilitator should take role if no one willing to take part**

3. Distribute tools for sound corresponding to script

  **Note: Have non script readers or the corresponding readers holding the tools**

4. Have fun

### Have fun

The folies activity pairs well with quieter activities to create a sense of contrast. Letting all the noise out from everyday life and then taking a chance to relax and forget about them for a short time. 

Fun is the most important part. Everyone involved in the folie should be having fun, be that playing a character or making noise. Having fun creates the most energy and distraction from every day life and encorages relaxation.
