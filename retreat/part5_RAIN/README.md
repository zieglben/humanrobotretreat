# RAIN Guided Meditation

This section of the retreat features a guided mindfulness exercise using the R.A.I.N. meditation technique—a practice developed by Tara Brach to help participants explore difficult emotions with compassion and awareness. "RAIN" stands for Recognize, Allow, Investigate, and Nurture.

## Overview

Time: 1:15 - 1:45

Activity: Participants were guided through the meditation using a combination of the human facilitators' introduction and a pre-recorded human narration of the RAIN practice. The use of two different voices and introductions offered a balance of novelty and grounding, helping participants stay focused and emotionally engaged.

## Purpose

The RAIN meditation was selected for its alignment with the retreat’s themes of silence, reflection, and emotional self-awareness. It served as a gentle yet powerful transition between the silent outdoor activity and the movement-based session that followed.

## Implementation

Audio Track: A pre-recorded version of Tara Brach’s RAIN meditation played following the introduction.

Environment: The room was kept quiet, dimly lit, and distraction-free to support inward focus. Participants were seated or lying down with eyes closed.

## Why It Worked

RAIN helped participants process their silent nature experience and re-center emotionally before returning to group activities.
Additionally, participants reported feeling calmer, more aware, and more present after the session.
