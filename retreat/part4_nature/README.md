In this portion of the retreat, participants were encouraged to _silently_ take a 15-minute walk outside of the retreat room, focusing on observing the nature around them. This form of visual, self-led mindfulness was a refreshing break in the otherwise enclosed experience. Continuing the _noble silence_, this section served as a focused intermission.

We encouraged participants to bring one or two items back from their walk to place in front of a visual language model (VLM) developed by graduate students in the CHARISMA lab. This VLM was asked to make observations about the item in front of it and draw comparisons between the item and mindfulness.

The **motivation** behind this exercise was to compare how much humans observe vs. AI language models and how that comparison can reveal characteristics about the human observer.
