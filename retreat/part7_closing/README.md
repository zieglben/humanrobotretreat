## Overview

Time: 2:15â€“2:45

Activity: Group Sharing & Contemplation

### Flow

Participants split into breakout groups to practice the Speaker-Listener model.

Each pair takes turns speaking and listening, supported by a custom-developed AI that assists with thought witnessing.

After small group practice, participants return to the full circle for group sharing, reflecting on both human-AI and human-human interactions.

### Purpose
The exercise helps participants experience mindful communication, develop deeper listening skills, and explore the role of AI in supporting contemplation and dialogue.
